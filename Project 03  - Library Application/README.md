This is a Spring web application which was made in order to teach myself web developement and improve my knowledge by putting in practice, for starters, some basic web development concepts and knowledge 
into practice. Moreover, this application served as a project for a class ,,Project III Tools for Progamming Development'' in first semester of last year of university.

For further details, please consult the documentation on **Final Report.pdf**

P.S : I know it might take a while since this application and documentation is a work of progress, but I am trying to improve it whenever I have the time :)
